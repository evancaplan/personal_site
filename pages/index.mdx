# Your Name

Hey, I'm Evan. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Trinity Logistics. I am a full stack engineer and specialize in building web apps using MySQL, Java 11, Spring Boot, Typescript, and Angular.
In my spare time I am the CTO of Humisoft. We are building a mobile app using Amazon Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon AppSync. I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and have a lot of interest in the cloud.

I love to travel and I love nature. I have been to 22 national parks and 16 countries. I got a degree in Geology because of my passion for the outdoors and curiosity of the processes that shape our environment. I got a minor in computer science because of my love for problem-solving. My wife is a Brazilian citizen, and I am currently travelling a lot to Goi√¢nia.
I also love to learn languages (other than programming languages), and right now I am learning Portuguese.
